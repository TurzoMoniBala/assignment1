      <h1>Our Donate Plan</h1>
      <p>
        Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities
        themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too. Millions of people
        give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as
        well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.

          and food contribute to a person's physical and social well being
          throughout life. Dictionary definitions of food include terms such as
          nourishing, sustaining growth, or furnishing energy.
